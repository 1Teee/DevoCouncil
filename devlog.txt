* general cleanup: README.md and skeleton code
  - updated README: added having python being installed on the machine that runs the code
  - added a lot of files with shell code in templates, and some shell code in __innit__.py, that we can build on. This     was done in school but there was not enough time to fill out the devlog

* cleaned up devlog.txt, made it more organized and visually appealing

ivanG -- 2024-11-2 21:32
* update devlog
  - did work on the home and login page, with some basics to start out, where it sees if the user is logged in, if not it sends them to the login page. This was done in class on 10-31, but alas, the period ended before I could update the devlog.
